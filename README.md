Web application for organizing and sorting shopping lists

Is organizing your shopping list taking too long or are you short on planning time and waste a lot of time in the store sorting through your unorganized and confusing shopping list? If you dread all the tedious work that goes into planning your shopping trips or have come to dread the actual time spent shopping, ShopEasy is the app for you. I decided to make this app because it was becoming too time consuming and confusing for me to have to look through my entire shopping list to figure out which stores I had to visit to get all the items on the list. When I arrived at a specific store it also took a lot of time and brain power to constantly scan my master shopping list to figure out which items I could pick up at that specific store and which ones I couldn't.  So to save time during shopping, I started to meticulously pre-plan my shopping trips by making separate shopping lists for each store. One advantage was I could compare lists to determine which store to visit first to get the most items in one stop thus cutting down the number of stores I had to visit.  One disadvantage was there were many duplicate items across the lists because most items could be purchased from multiple stores. It became a hassle to have to bring all the lists to every store so that I could cross off duplicate items that have been purchased. The application I designed does all of this for me automatically after I input my item  and eliminates all the hassle of organizing my shopping list and cuts down on my planning and shopping time.

The main page of Shopeasy takes you to the "Family Shopping List", the master shopping list, so that you can get an idea of what is on your list and whether it is time to hit the stores.  All of the features of the web application is easily accessed from the navigation bar on the top of the page (the same navigation bar appears on all pages of the web application).  The links on the navigation bar provide several useful tools to increase your shopping efficiency.  First, the "Add a new item" link takes you to a form where you can enter all the details about your item including the name of the item and a description for what you need.  You also need to select a category for your item and select all the stores where this item is available for puchase which will allow the app to sort your lists by stores and show you which store departments you need to visit.  The "Shopping List by Stores" link displays your shopping list by stores and also provides a summary table with all of the stores in your list and the items for each store side by side to allow you to easily determine which store to visit to pick up the most number of items on your shopping list.  After you have purchased an item on your list, simply click the "Purchased" button and the item will be moved into your "Inventory" page.  The "Inventory" page keeps track of what items you have on hand in your household.  On the "Inventory" page, you can simply click the "Restock" button when you run out of a frequently used item and that item will be added back to your shopping list.  The "Restock" button first takes you to a form where you can edit the details of your item in case your needs have changed.  There is also an "Edit" button for each item that allows you to change the details of your item if you make a mistake while entering your item or if your needs have changed. You can also delete the item by clicking the "Delete" button.  Some items on your shopping list may be a one-time purchase but you may want to keep the details of the item in your records for future reference. Simply click the "Archive" button and the information will be stored in the "Archived Items" page.  Finally,  family members can log into the web application and add their requests.  Their usernames will automatically appear as the requester so you know who asked for which item.  Each user is able to navigate to their own shopping list page called "My Shopping List" to see which of their requested items have been purchased so that they don't have to constantly nag the shopper for an update. 

In the future, I hope to create a similar application for the Android and iOS platforms that will sync with the web application.
